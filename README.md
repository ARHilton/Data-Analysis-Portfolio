## About Me

Hi, I'm Arthur! I have an education background in Physics and a diverse range of professional experience. As a Data Analyst and passionate reflexive learner, I constantly seek to acquire new skills and take on challenges in line with my core values and ambitions. Inquisitive by nature, I am interested in both systems and people and recognize that human beings are story orientated creatures. My vision is to bridge the gap between the two, leveraging my Data Analysis acumen and interpersonal skills to tell stories with data, describing and uncovering the hidden areas where true value resides. 

Drawing from my diverse, worldly experience, I bring a problem focused, person orientated perspective to the table. Whether racing across Cairo to gather Cost-of-Living data, interviewing locals about black market currency exchange in Sri Lanka or researching hyperinflation in Turkey, I am intrepid in my desire to get to the root cause of an issue and extract the best outcomes, cutting across cultural barriers in the process. 

Recently enrolled in the Data Analytics Career Accelerator program with the London School of Economics, (LSE), I've learned the language and mindset of a Data Analyst from leading experts in the field and am excitedly looking forward to extracting greater value from data than ever before.

## Portfolio Projects

In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Supermarket Customer Analysis

**Presentation:** [pdf](https://github.com/ARHilton/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/2Market%20Customer%20Analysis.pdf)
 
**Description:** A project focussed on exploring the customer demographics of a supermarket retailer as well as explaining customer behaviour and their responsivity to different advertisments. The dataset contained several thousand rows of customer data, including customer id, information on age, marriage status, family size, income level, nationality, online/in store preference and the proclivity to respond to adverisements. An additional dataset included a record of advertisements served via different mediums (mail/X/Instagram/Facebook). The data was initially cleaned and explored using Excell and later fed into Tableau. Several dashboard were created to answer key business questions related to the problem statement.
